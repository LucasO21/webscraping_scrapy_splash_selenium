# Web Scraping with Python Scrapy Splash and Selenium

====================================================================================

This repository contains code and resources for learning web scraping with Scrapy Splash and Selenium in Python. The code examples are a combination of resources from the Udemy course [Modern Web Scraping with Python using Scrapy Splash Selenium]("https://www.udemy.com/course/web-scraping-in-python-using-scrapy-and-splash/") and personal projects. See ```tutorials``` folder for code from course lectures and ```projects``` for personal projects.

## Getting Started

If you would like to reproduce some of these projects, you will need to have [Python 3.x]("https://www.python.org/downloads/") installed on your local machine. It is also recommended to use a virtual environment for managing Python packages. You can create a new virtual environment using the following command:

```python3 -m venv env```

## Requirements & Dependencies

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

* Installing Poetry: ```pipx install poetry```.
* Create a Virtual Env with Poetry: ```poetry init``` (follow on screen instructions).
* Install Dependencies: ```poetry Install```.
* You can also just get the package versions from the ```pyproject.toml``` file and install in your python environment.
