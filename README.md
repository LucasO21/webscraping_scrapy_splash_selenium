# Web Scraping with Scrapy Splash and Selenium in Python

============================================================================================

This repository contains code and resources for learning web scraping with Scrapy Splash and Selenium in Python. The code examples are a combination of resources from the Udemy course [Modern Web Scraping with Python using Scrapy Splash Selenium]("https://www.udemy.com/course/web-scraping-in-python-using-scrapy-and-splash/") and personal projects.

## Getting Started

If you would like to reproduce some of these projects, you will need to have [Python 3.x]("https://www.python.org/downloads/") installed on your local machine. It is also recommended to use a virtual environment for managing Python packages. You can create a new virtual environment using the following command:

```python3 -m venv env```

## Requirements

For reproducibility, see ```requirements.txt``` file Python packages/versions used in this project. To install the same set of packages, use the following command:

```pip install -r requirments.txt```

## Contributing

This repo is a personal project. However feel free to fork the repository and adapt code examples to your own projects. For any issues, feel free to open an issue.
